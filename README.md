# Terragrunt

These modules are written to be used via terragrunt. See
mediwareinc/aws-infrastructure.

# `terraform fmt`

The Terraform modules in this repo are formatted using the `terraform fmt`
command. Your editor may have a plugin to support automatically formatting them,
or you can alternatively just run `terraform fmt` from the commandline.
